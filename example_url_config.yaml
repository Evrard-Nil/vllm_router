# Simplified vLLM Router Configuration
# Configuration is done through a YAML file with a list of backends.
# Models are automatically discovered by using the v1/models endpoint of the backends.

# Required: List of backend URLs
vllm_backends:
  - "http://localhost:8000"

# Other vllm routers to forward requests to if no vLLM backends are available
router_backends:
  - "http://localhost:8002"

# Optional: Basic server settings
host: "0.0.0.0"
port: 8001
log_level: "info"

# Optional: Routing configuration
routing_logic: "roundrobin" # Options: roundrobin, session, kvaware, prefixaware, disaggregated_prefill

# Optional: Advanced settings
refresh_interval: 30 # How often to refresh model discovery (seconds)
health_check_timeout_seconds: 10 # Timeout for backend health checks

# Optional: Session-based routing (only used when routing_logic is "session")
# session_key: "X-Session-ID"

# Optional: Custom callbacks for request handling
# callbacks: "my_callbacks:callback_handler"
